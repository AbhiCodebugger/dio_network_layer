Ever wondered how a professional team sets up a robust networking layer in a Flutter project? Here's a look at a clean, scalable, and maintainable approach using the powerful `dio` package. 🚀

I've built a networking module that is completely isolated and packed with features to handle real-world scenarios gracefully. The goal is to make network requests reliable and easy to manage.

Here’s a breakdown of the key features:

**🌐 Dio-Powered Core**
Utilizes the popular `dio` library for flexible and powerful HTTP requests.

**🔌 Smart Interceptors**
**Authentication:** Automatically injects auth tokens into requests.
**Connectivity:** Checks for an active internet connection before a request is made.
**Logging:** Provides detailed request/response logs for easy debugging.
**Retries:** Automatically retries failed requests due to network issues.

**🚨 Centralized Error Handling**
A unified system to manage API exceptions, timeouts, and other network failures, converting them into clean, actionable error objects.

**🏭 Dio Factory**
A single source for configuring and creating `dio` instances, ensuring consistency across the app.

**🔄 Safe Response Parsing**
Includes a response converter to safely parse JSON and prevent crashes from unexpected data structures.

This setup not only makes the code cleaner but also significantly improves the app's reliability and the developer experience.
